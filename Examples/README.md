## Examples

Included here are two examples, eclipse-predictions.py and solar-system-animation.py which both use real world data from NASA's JPL Horizons API for the positions, velocities and masses of the celestial bodies in our solar system. This data is included in the .json file '2025-mar-10' which included data from the 10th March 2025 @ 00:00:00 UT

# eclipse-predictions.py

Simulates 10 years of gravitational interaction in the Sun-Earth-Moon system and uses trigometry to calculate when solar eclipses will occur

# solar-system-animation.py 

Simulates 10 years of gravitational interaction across all of the planets in the solar system plus Earth's moon, and animates their motion using matplotlib.animation
